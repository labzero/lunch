An app for groups to decide on nearby lunch options. [Check out a live version](https://lunch.pink), or [read the blog post about it!](https://labzero.com/people/blog/lunch-search-no-longer-to-sate-your-hunger)

## Setup

### `/etc/hosts`

Add this line to `/etc/hosts`:

```
127.0.0.1 local.lunch.pink
```

If you will be testing subdomains, you should add an additional line for each subdomain, e.g.:

```
127.0.0.1 labzero.local.lunch.pink
127.0.0.1 someotherteam.local.lunch.pink
```

If you want to run integration tests, you will also need to add:

```
127.0.0.1 integration-test.local.lunch.pink
```

### Environment variables

Make two copies of `.env.sample`, named `.env` and `.env.prod`.

#### Google project

For `GOOGLE_*` env variables:

- Create a Google Developer app in the [console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
- Enable the Google+ API, Contacts API, Maps JavaScript API, Places API, and Geocoding API.
- Click the OAuth Consent tab and add click "Edit app".
- Add `lunch.pink` as an authorized domain.
- Click the Credentials tab and choose "OAuth client ID" from the Create Credentials dropdown.
- Choose "Web application" as the type.
- For local development:
  - Enter `http://local.lunch.pink:3000` and `https://local.lunch.pink:3000` as authorized JavaScript origins
  - Enter `http://local.lunch.pink:3000/login/google/callback` and `https://local.lunch.pink:3000/login/google/callback` as authorized redirect URIs
- Add your deployment target(s) as additional origins/redirect URIs.
- Go back to the Credentials tab and create two API keys - one for the client, and one for the server.
- On each API key, add `http://lunch.pink`, `https://lunch.pink`, `http://*.lunch.pink`, and `https://*.lunch.pink` as HTTP referrers.

#### Database

Set up a PostgreSQL database and enter the admin credentials into `.env`. If you want to use another database dialect, change it in `database.js`.

After setting up and starting the app, you will be able to log in with this user and create a team. If you did not supply a SUPERUSER_PASSWORD, you will need to log in via OAuth, using the email address you supplied for SUPERUSER_EMAIL.

### Commands

After setting up your environment:

First, [install Yarn.](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) Then:

```bash
yarn
npx sequelize db:migrate
```

To seed your database with a Superuser, fill out the `SUPERUSER_*` env variables accordingly, then run

```bash
npx sequelize db:seed:all
```

## Development server

### Running

```bash
npm start
```

`npm start` will default to `localhost`, but the browser should point to `https://local.lunch.pink:3000`

#### Logging in

If you are logged into the production version of Lunch, you will need to log out in order to log in locally. This is due to the `*.lunch.pink` cookie conflicting with the `*.local.lunch.pink` cookie.

## Production server

### Building

```bash
npm run build
```

### Running

```bash
node build/server.js
```

### Deploying

You can modify `tools/deploy.js` as needed to work with your deployment strategy.

## Service Worker

To run the service worker locally, follow the above steps to run the production server. After testing the service worker, be sure to unregister the service worker in the browser (or close all local Lunch tabs) to avoid issues when testing on the development server.

## Testing

### Unit tests

```bash
npm test
```

To run an individual file:

```bash
npm run test-file /path/to/file
```

#### Testing with coverage

```bash
npm run coverage
```

### Integration tests

Make sure your `.env` file is filled out. Set up a separate test database using the same user as your development environment. Enter the following into `.env.test`:

```bash
DB_NAME=your_test_db_name
SUPERUSER_NAME=test
SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=test
SUPERUSER_EMAIL=test@lunch.pink
USE_HTTPS=false
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run integration
```

Individual files can be run using:

```bash
npm run integration-file path/to/file
```

Or selected using the Cypress Test Runner in interactive mode:

```bash
npm run integration-interactive
```

### Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

## More info

This project was created using [React Starter Kit](https://reactstarter.com/). Many technology choices originate from its [repository](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit), but this project adds on [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/), RESTful APIs instead of GraphQL, and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/).
